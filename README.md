# Calculator
## Project Details
This project is related to a one line calculator in Python.

## Project Requirements
- #### One line
All of the users input must be only in one line eg; 8*8.
The program must check for (lack of) spaces in the user input, eg; 8 * 8 or 8*8, 8* 8

- #### Mathmatical Requirements
The program must be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
All of the outputs must be correct.

- #### Testing
Throughout the process, tests should be done to ensure the codes reliability.
All features must be checked, eg A * A (This should prompt the user to re add the input)

- #### Output
The output should be clean, and allow for the user to easily understand the output.

- #### Additional Commands
A additional command allowing for debug must be included, this command should include the amount of times operations are changed, and any other information relevant to testing.
Another command must be working, this command should allow for the user to see the working that the system did to solve the equation.
Command formatting should be done with --, eg; 8 * * --debug
